## 🛠 Developer & Customization Guide

Agency Nexus is built with a highly modular architecture, making it easy for developers to extend its functionality.

### 🔌 Modular Hooks
*   `agency_nexus_project_status_updated`: Fired whenever a project status changes. Ideal for custom integrations.
*   `agency_nexus_dashboard_widgets`: Action hook to add custom widgets to the main Nexus dashboard.

### 🔌 Code Quality & WordPress Standards Compliance
*   **Early Form Processing:** To eliminate `headers already sent` redirection warnings, form POST data and redirects are handled during the `admin_init` action hook before HTML headers and page rendering begin.
*   **Safe Variable Notices:** Superglobal arrays (e.g., `$_POST`, `$_GET`) are checked securely with fallback values to avoid PHP `Undefined array key` notices.

### 🌐 REST API Endpoints
The plugin exposes several endpoints for external integrations (e.g., mobile apps or custom lead forms):
*   `POST /wp-json/agency-nexus/v1/leads/capture`: Programmatically ingest leads from any source.
*   `GET /wp-json/agency-nexus/v1/projects`: Retrieve authorized project data for the current user.

### 🧪 Database Schema
All custom tables are prefixed with `an_` (e.g., `wp_an_projects`, `wp_an_tasks`). Refer to `includes/class-db-manager.php` for the full schema definitions.
